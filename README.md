Group project done for an introduction to data analysis course.

Results were presented during an interactive demo, therefore most of the slides shows only graphs and no interpretation. 

The analysis is performed on a dataset of top 250 most expensive football transfers from season 2000-2001 until 2018-2019 available on Kaggle.
